FRONTEND FIX RECORDS - September 21, 2025
===============================================

(1)PROBLEM IN THE STUDENT VIEW COMPONENT

(.)Fixed the loadStudents function - Removed the broken response.data extraction and used the data directly from teacherAPI.getStudents()
(.)Updated the Student interface - Added _id field since your backend returns _id instead of id
(.)Fixed the key prop - Used student._id || student.id || student.studentID to handle different ID field names
(.)Added console logging to help debug what data is being received

(2)PROBLEM IN THE Teacher part (not able to see the marks)
(.)the code was writeen to show the hardcoded values so i added the code for getting the marks in 
    api.ts also in the teacher part and also changed the code (api.localstorage ) to take the data 
    from the mongodb 
(.) after that it is showing the marks perfectly

(3)PROBLEM not able to save the homework in the mongodb
    (.) here are all the issues 
        (1)=>The interface had subject as optional, but it should be required
        (2)=>No validation was being performed before submitting
        (3)=>Potential issues with data preparation and structure
    (.)here are the solutions
       (1)=>Made subject required in the interface
       (2)=>Added comprehensive console logging
       (3)=>Added boxSizing: 'border-box' to prevent layout issues
